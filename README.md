# Alzheimer-s-Disease-Prediction-using-3D-MRI-scans

Use of Machine Learning algorithms in Medical Image Processing is challenging and innovative research oriented prject. 

As a part of the project, I tried using pre-trained CNN models including:
1. VGG16
2. LeNet
3. Inception
4. ResNet

# Machine Learning Techniques

1. Convolutional Neural Networks
2. Auto encoders

Feature Extraction using Image Processing 

# Open Sources used:

keras, sklearn, pandas, numpy, PyTorch
OPenCV

These pre-trained models gave results which suffered from overfitting. Further feature extraction and image processing followed by GANs/ encoder may improve the accuracy.

# Dataset used:

The dataset was collected from OASIS https://www.oasis-brains.org/


Here is a link for the dataset:
